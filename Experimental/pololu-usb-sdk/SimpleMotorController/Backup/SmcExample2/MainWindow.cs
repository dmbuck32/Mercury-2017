/*  SmcExample2:
 *    Simple example GUI for the Pololu Simple Motor Controller,
 *    written in Visual C#.
 *    
 *    Features:
 *       Persistent native USB connection using Smc class
 *       Scroll bar to set speed
 *       Stop button
 *       Resume button to clear errors
 * 
 *  Troubleshooting:
 * 
 *    The Input Mode of your Simple Motor Controller must be set to Serial/USB
 *    for this program to work properly.  You must also connect USB, motor power,
 *    and your motor.
 *  
 *    If the label says "Disconnected", make sure your device is plugged in to USB,
 *    check your Device Manager (Windows) or run lsusb (Linux), and close any other
 *    programs using the device.
 * 
 *    If the label says "Connected" but the scroll bar does not work, try pressing
 *    the Resume button.  If that does not work, use the Pololu Simple Motor Control
 *    Center to check what errors are occurring.
 *  
 *    The scroll bar will NOT work if the red LED of your motor controller is on
 *    (i.e. whenever there are errors stopping the motor).
 *
