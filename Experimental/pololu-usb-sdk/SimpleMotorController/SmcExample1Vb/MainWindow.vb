' SmcExample1Vb:
'   Simple example GUI for the Pololu Simple Motor Controller,
'   written in Visual Basic .NET.
' 
'   Features:
'       Native USB connection using Smc class
'       Forward button
'       Reverse button
'       Stop button
'
' NOTE: The Input Mode of your Simple Motor Controller must be set to Serial/USB
' for this program to work properly.  You must also connect USB, motor power,
' and your motor.  If this program does not work, use the Pololu Simple Motor
' Control Center to check what errors are occurring.
